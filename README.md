### Contributing

If you wish to contribute, checkout the [/docs](https://github.com/sliechti/feedrdr/tree/master/docs) directory or 
feature requests on http://rdr.uservoice.com/.

I plan to go over them one by one as I find the time to do so.

Feel free to contact me at steven -at- feedrdr.co if you need help setting up the environment or 
building the sources, I'll document the steps at the same time.
