Clean data older than needed, eg read items or news older than 30 days ...
  All that data can be archived.
  
Add SSO support for Twitter accounts

Setting password for FB/Google/Hotmail users

Landing page

Add an input text to the start page and a link or + button somewhere it makes sense.

I was thinking in having a sub-menu that appears slides to the right of the menu, with the list of sub-feeds. 
In case people want to browse one subscription instead of the complete stream group.
The add/remove subscriptions table still has some issues I'm working on.

Explicitly mark as read. 

Replace save for Star/Favorites

Import single feed.
	Fetch name from source.
	
For people that liking reading (ALL) news, not just unread. Make it possible to have a marker. 
	Bookmark of last position. Or bookmarks?

For showing next stream group and before, remember the left and right positions when the stream loads for the first time, instead
of using the values after runQuery runs. When in unread mode the stream goes down to last and at that point it has only
a stream group up.
 
Show total entries in stream group.
	- See {{i_total_entries}}
	- Source shows the total entries visible to user + total entries the ource has.
	
Feeds site.
	- Like collections, let users add new subscriptions from global feedsources
	
Make it possible to add default settings for new streams. 
	What view, 
	what mode, unread, 
	what sorting.
	
Trigger verify email again.

ALL
	Remeber last position, on click.
make settings device dependent, eg iphone, tablet, desktop ...

let user customize themes, share theme

Mobile. jump next stream, last stream.

option to move streams to other profiles

possible to build a trending line, what was trending at 8am, at 10, at 12pm ...

mobile, hide menu with swipe

Show user type right of display name (FREE, BASIC, PRO)
	Make upgradable, payment.
	FREE with google ads?
	
Add subscription link on empty stream should work., move to the subscription to the list of active subscriptions.

Move show menu right from Logo. 
	Not on stream footer.
	x. Ok right of stream group's name.
	
Feed source view
	x. No need to show right tools, All, Unread. 
		List views OK.
			No need to save info, initial view is list or inherited from stream group view when clicked.

Keyboard navigation
	Make it configurable.

Move context params from web.xml to context.properties

Better import result page.
  http://localhost:8080/feedreader/pages/import.jsp
  
List view should default to more than 20 entries.

Import to selected profiles only by default.
	All should be below.

Let users rename profiles on import.

Let users build some initial content, easy, quick.
	Like a wizard on the first log in/or when user has no subscriptions.
				 
http://feedrdr.co/pages/reader.jsp
   x. Empty home page shouldn't show mark read.
   x. Show import, create stream group
   Move handlebar templates to js. so they are cached.

Loading backgrounds.
	There is library that does a loading on a line.
	
After mark all read
	Go to last stream / next stream selection should be remembered.
		Settings can keep track of those selections so people can remove the default setting.
		
Save content to lists of content. E.g I want to have a list of comics
	Comics 
		\ XKCD
			Let me extract content, so if the page is deleted, I still have a copy of it.
			
Delete stream [x] right of stream entry in menu?

Mark all streams as read. 0 unread.

Stream menu title braking if too long when scroll bar appears. E.g Engeneering_CAD_CAM

Save news - change color, switch back after x seconds.

Move to next stream, skip streams with 0 unreads.

Option to set view settings for all streams.

Initial news count for line mode should be higher ... otherwise you can see the load more link.

News lines - expandable panel.

    Build category list:
        Based on categories manually added by admins
            Some feeds provide XMLAttributes, this could be used as hints.
            Using NLP we could dissert the category based on words
                For the first range of ranking we could try this approach, quick and dirty.
        http://www.inoreader.com/discovery/bundles_top

    10-20 categories with 10, 20 feeds each.

When managing subscriptions.
    Able to save query results as stream group, e.g programming.
    - query with support for regex?

If content was cut, go back and search for last space .. otherwise it looks weird.

    Find out how to enhance news entries based on "known" sites with APIs.
    - For example for reddit urls, show the upvotes/downvotes.
    - Think of making this a "connector" framework.
      For example a connector would offer some sort of standard attributes, like comments, title, pictures ...

    Instead of registering every click. 
        Register a users click and have a job collect all that information hourly.

Build xml handlers for specific XML namespaces.
    We can either pack that information in the feed entry table OR
    Create new tables to hold that data:
        E.g FeedEntriesGDInfo

            xml_name, xml_value
