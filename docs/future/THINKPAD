Introduce an internal raking system for news/source entries
	Based on likes from users, with more weight on friends circles.
	
For source to sites that offer APIs, like reddit, stack exchange, etc.
    Wouldn't it be great if we can expand the news entry with information they provide?
    E.g up/down votes. Raking, badges, etc....
    Github etc..

Study bookmarks: Many resources there.

Unlimited stream. When last unread, load stream starts adding the next one.

Add facebook page feeds.

Show related news once you read an article or you request it.
    I saw an article about touchless payments in switzerland. Who else reported it?
    What other kind of touchless payments are there?

Admin APP for Android.
    See thread fetching status, etc.

Learn how minifying workflow works:

    # runs jshint, the unit test suite, and builds a minified version of the file.
    grunt build

What other input feeds could we add?
    Facebook?
    Yahoo pipes?
